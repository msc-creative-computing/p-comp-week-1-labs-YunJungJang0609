This is a Whac-A-Mole game for the people living in the future.
Everybody is obese and nobody tries to move, as everything is automatic in the future.
Therefore, they need to play a game for certain amount of time to unlock their devices.

1. The game will sense the temperature of its player to choose a level of the game (human and alien level).

2. The player needs to press the push button of each LED when they blink.

3. The score can be checked through the consol window. When the player gets 5 points, the system will start.
